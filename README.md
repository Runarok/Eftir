# eftir

This repository serves as a temporary space where I place random projects, ideas, and experiments until I determine their proper place.

Often, the repo may appear empty or inactive because I regularly organize and relocate its contents. However, there are times when I simply need a spot to quickly store spontaneous creations or thoughts without a specific plan or category, intending to revisit and organize them later.

While some might just save these files locally and leave them, I find it safer and more convenient to keep them on GitHub. This way, I can clear out my local folders to keep things tidy and still access my work from anywhere without carrying files around.

In essence, **eftir** functions as a flexible holding area for my diverse and arbitrary workâ€”a creative playground awaiting its final home.
